## About Discovery AI

Discovery AI refers to the area of artificial intelligence that is focused on uncovering new knowledge including novel insights, signatures (such as biomarkers), causal relationships, and hypotheses across various fields including healthcare, science, and law.

Key components of Discovery AI include:
- Machine learning and deep learning
- Natural language processing
- Reasoning including causal inference

Examples include:
- AI models analysing genomic and proteomic data to identify novel biomarkers for diseases like cancer.
- AI models analysing epidemiological data to understand novel causal factors behind virus spread.
- AI-powered tools like IBM Watson sifting through scientific papers to suggest new, unexplored research directions.
- AI systems analysing legal texts to discover relevant case laws, precedents, and compliance requirements.
